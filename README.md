Mountain hut and trails - SQL Day2
A ski resort company is planning to construct a new ski slope using a pre-existing network of mountain huts and trails between them. A new slope has to begin at one of the mountain huts have a middle station at another hut connected with the first one by a direct trail, and end at the third mountain hut which is also connected by a direct trail to the second hut. The altitude of the three huts chosen for constructing the ski slopes has to be strictly decreasing 

Each Entry in the table trails represent a direct connection between huts with ID;s hut1 and hut2 Note that all trails are bidirectional 

Create a query that finds all triplets (startpt, middlept,endpt)representing the mountain huts that may be used for construction of a ski slope
output returned by the query can be ordered in any way
